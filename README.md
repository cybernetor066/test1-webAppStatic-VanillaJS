Hello everyone, welcome to my "HTML5&CSS3 web development" repository. This repo illustrates and shows you all the example codes, my custom solutions to the excercises and the personal projects that i completed during the course of my training and practical tasks on learning this particular course. Please feel free to contact me if you had any challenge running these live codes. Make sure to test run the codes through a local server scheme like "liveserver" in vs-code for easy reloading of the web page(specifically the <textbook_examples1.html> file). Thanks
