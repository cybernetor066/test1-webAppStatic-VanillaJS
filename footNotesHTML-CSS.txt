#Notes: 
#1. Its Good to know that in styling websites with the use of CSS3, the use of  ---px---
     versus ---%--- value's unit during setting properties like the "top" CSS3 property for example,
     there is always a difference between the two of them. the use of px is advised if the page
     contents has the tendency to increase in future so as to avoid overlapping and hence 
     mis-alignment of that element/page.
